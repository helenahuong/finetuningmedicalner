**Named Entity Recognition (NER) for Medical Texts**

**Introduction**

This project builds a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model for medical texts using Hugging Face's transformers library. The model identifies and classifies entities such as diseases and medications within a text.

**Setup**

Prerequisites
Python 3.6 or higher
Pip (Python package installer)

**Virtual Environment**

It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

**Install Dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**Running the Project**

Create Dataset: Run the dataset creation script.

python data/create_dataset.py


Train Model: Train the NER model.

python models/train_model.py


Run App: Start the Gradio app for interactive testing.

python app/app.py

**Key Concepts**

**Fine-Tuning**

Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a specific task with a relatively smaller dataset. This approach leverages the knowledge the model has already learned, making it faster and more efficient to adapt to new tasks. In this project, we fine-tune a transformer model to perform NER on medical texts.

**PyTorch**

PyTorch is an open-source deep learning framework developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It provides flexibility and speed, making it popular for both academic research and production deployment. PyTorch is used in this project to handle the model training and inference processes.

**Hugging Face**

Hugging Face is a company that has developed a suite of tools for natural language processing (NLP). Their transformers library provides pre-trained models for various NLP tasks, including NER, text classification, and translation. It simplifies the process of implementing state-of-the-art NLP models by providing easy-to-use APIs.

**Transformers**

Transformers are a type of neural network architecture designed to handle sequential data, such as text, by using mechanisms like self-attention to understand the context of each word in a sentence. They have become the foundation of many NLP models due to their effectiveness in capturing long-range dependencies and contextual relationships. In this project, a transformer model is fine-tuned to recognize entities in medical texts.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates how to build a robust NER system for medical texts using modern NLP techniques. By leveraging pre-trained transformer models and fine-tuning them, we achieve high performance with less data and computational resources. Hugging Face's libraries and PyTorch provide the tools necessary to implement and deploy these models efficiently.
